# YOLOv5-Android-Unity-Inference
From start to finish with YOLOv5: From custom training data to Android Unity inference.

1. Prepare custom data and perform labeling using CVAI.
2. Training with YOLOv5 using PyTorch.
3. Verify training results using a webcam (e.g., with OpenCV).
4. Converting to ONNX for inference in Unity.
5. Inference in Unity.
